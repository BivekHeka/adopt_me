    <p>A rescue dog is a dog that has been placed in a new home after being abused, neglected, or abandoned by its
        previous owner. The term can also apply to dogs that are found as strays, surrendered by owners for a variety of
        reasons, including relationship breakdowns, moving home where the owner is unable or unwilling to take their
        pets or elderly people who are not permitted to take their dog(s) into a nursing home.

        Many animal rescue organizations exist to rescue, protect, care for, and re-home dogs from unnecessary
        euthanasia. Common examples include the RSPCA in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries, the ISPCA
        in Ireland, and the ASPCA in the United States. Many rescue dogs are rehomed quickly, but some wait longer for a
        home. This may be relevant when the dog is older. Some agencies provide ongoing health care and support for
        older dogs after they have been placed in a home. There are several charities dedicated to rescuing and rehoming
        older dogs.

        The ASPCA estimates that approximately 3.3 million dogs in the United States enter shelters each year. Of these,
        1.6 million are adopted, 670,000 are euthanized, and 620,000 are returned to their previous owners. A study
        conducted by the United States National Council on Pet Population Study and Policy (NCPPSP) in 1998 found that
        the main reasons for pets being relinquished are: family moving, the landlord will not allow pets, too many
        animals in the household, cost of keeping the pet, the owner is having personal problems, inadequate facilities,
        and no homes available for puppies. The study found that 47.7% of dogs turned in to shelters were not altered
        (spayed or neutered), 33% had not been to a veterinarian, and 96% of dogs had no obedience training. The
        researchers concluded that the owners who were relinquishing their pets did not know to be responsible dog
        owners and that educational programs aimed at present and prospective owners would reduce the number of dogs
        relinquished to animal shelters.
