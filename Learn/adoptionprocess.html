    <h1>Adoption Process</h1>

        <p>The central issue in adoption is whether the new adopter can provide a safe, secure, and permanent home for the
            adopted pet. Responsible shelters, pounds, and rescue organizations refuse to supply pets to people whom they
            deem ineligible based on assessing their inability to supply the adopted animal with a suitable home. Sometimes,
            a new owner may face training or behavioral challenges with a pet who has been neglected, abused, or left
            untrained. In the vast majority of cases, patience, training, persistence, and consistency of care will help the
            pet overcome its past.
            In Canada, reputable animal shelters or humane societies go through an extensive process to ensure that
            potential pets and their respective families are well suited and prepared for their lives ahead. Adoption fees
            include spaying/neutering, veterinary care including all updated vaccinations, micro-chipping, and pet
            insurance. Phone interviews, written questionnaires, and in-person visits gather information on the potential
            family's history with pets, their lifestyle, habits, and their ability to take on the conditions of the adopted
            pet. Adult pets can be more difficult to place because they may have existing habits or behaviors that are
            difficult to manage or unwanted. Unknown histories with rescue pets may also complicate their ability to be
            adopted. Shelters and humane societies remain connected with information packages on why pets are unwanted, what
            to expect in the first days, weeks, or months of pet adoption, guides, recommendations, specific behavior
            training requests, and follow-up calls to ensure that everyone is satisfied with the adoption.
            A forever home is the home of an adopter who agrees to be responsible for the animal for its entire life. There
            are two basic understandings of the concept. A broad interpretation simply says that the adopter of the pet
            agrees that the animal's well-being is now their responsibility for the rest of the animal's life. If the
            adopter can no longer keep the animal for any reason, they would need to be responsible for finding a healthy
            and happy home for the animal, and making sure that the people of the new home are taking good care of the
            animal for the rest of its life. Many animal rescues require adopters to return the animal to the rescue if they
            can no longer care for the animal. Should the adopter die before the animal, they should have a plan in place
            for the care of the animal. A more restrictive view that some shelters attempt to integrate as part of the
            adoption agreement puts conditions on when and why the adopter could arrange to move the animal to a new family.
            For example, forever home agreements might specify that the adopter will not get rid of the animal for trivial
            reasons, or that the adopter will always be sure that the animal will be permitted should they move to a new
            residence. Some agreements might specify allergies or violent behavior on the part of the animal as reasons
            allowable for an adopter to relinquish the animal.
            One problem shelters are fighting to overcome is what they term "Big Black Dog syndrome". Big black dogs (BBDs)
            are consistently the hardest dogs to placeâ€”even if they're friendly, well trained, and in perfect health. This
            may be due to several factors, including fear of stigma against certain breed types, attraction to ads and the
            fact that black dogs often do not photograph as well as lighter coated ones, and the fact that black dogs are
            often portrayed as aggressive in film and on television. Organizations have started campaigns to educate the
            public about BBD syndrome.
            Similarly, shelters often have difficulty placing black cats due to common superstitions regarding black cats as
            bringers or harbingers of bad luck. Some shelters also have policies halting or limiting the adoption of black
            cats immediately before Halloween for fear that the animals will be tortured, or used as "living decorations"
            for the holiday and then abandoned. Rabbits are sometimes treated in the same manner before Easter as well,
            though they are rarely found in regular shelters since they are considered "exotic" (anything not a dog or cat).
            Another popular fad is using a small dog, pretty white Persian kitten, or other small pet as a fashion accessory
            to "complement an outfit". Such animals may end up discarded, abandoned, or placed in a shelter when no longer
            needed.
    
            Education about and promotion of pet adoption is also done by animal welfare organizations, and by local
            government animal control agencies. In 2016, the U.S. state of Georgia made the "adoptable dog" its state dog,
            similar to Colorado's adopted dog.
    
            After filling out an application to adopt an animal, there is also an adoption fee that must be paid to adopt an
            animal. Adoption fees have several purposes that they fulfill. If someone is willing to pay for an animal
            chances are they will take care of him or her and not abuse or neglect their new pet. Most animals that are of
            age are spayed or neutered and up to date on all of their shots. Depending on the shelter or organization, some
            pets may be microchipped which helps locate them if they are lost. The adoption fees are in place to help cover
            these costs, and also help provide food for the animals left in the shelter.
