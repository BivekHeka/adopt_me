    <title>Responsible Pet Ownership</title>
</head>

<body>
    <p>According to the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) (2018), being responsible for a pet requires
        commitment and should be considered a privilege. Similar to having children, the pet depends on the owner for
        their needs such as food and shelter, exercise and mental stimulation, and veterinary care. When choosing to
        adopt a pet, the lifestyle of the owner and the pet should be compatible. Once a pet is chosen, the owner should
        ensure the pet has been spayed or neutered and properly identified. The responsibility to the animal should be a
        commitment for the lifetime of the pet. If the owner can no longer provide a suitable household for the animal,
        it should be the owner's priority to re-home the pet. The AVMA presents guidelines for being a responsible pet
        owner. This guideline is a good resource of what should be considered before becoming a pet owner. Thoughtful
        consideration should be used to ensure the resources and commitment are present to make the animal-human
        relationship beneficial for both.
